# eslint-toolbox

> A modern toolkit for ESLint configuration analysis and rule exploration

## Overview

eslint-toolbox is a monorepo project designed to solve ESLint configuration complexity through modern analysis and exploration tools. It provides comprehensive flat config analysis and information display functionality for developers working with ESLint in modern JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

## Architecture

This monorepo contains two packages that work together to provide ESLint configuration analysis:

```
eslint-toolbox/
├── packages/
│   ├── eslint-rule-explorer/      # 🔍 CLI tool for rule exploration
│   └── eslint-config-array-resolver/  # ⚙️  Internal flat config resolver
└── ...
```

### Packages

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **[eslint-rule-explorer](./packages/eslint-rule-explorer)** | CLI tool for retrieving and displaying detailed ESLint configuration information |
| **[@sushichan044/eslint-config-array-resolver](./packages/eslint-config-array-resolver)** | Internal library for resolving ESLint flat configuration modules |

## Development Setup

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) workspaces for efficient monorepo management.
